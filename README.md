# Yoep de GT Neo
Unofficial and opinionated Yoep de LEDLights profile adapted for the Simagic GT Neo wheel.

Yoep uses a 3-10-3 layout by default utilising 10 rev lights and two 3 LED status clusters. The GT Neo by Simagic has a 15 LED rev light bar and no status clusters.

I have aimed to provide Yoep's incredibly accurate and valuable work in a suitable format for the GT Neo. The source profile for this project was generated by Floyd's awesome generator.

Aims:
- Provide only rev light bar effects, as the status effects overwrite the edges of the rev bar.
- Centre certain effects and patterns on the rev bar, ie effects that require 6 flashing lights in the middle of the bar are adapted to 5 to centre them.
- Retain pit limiter effects only if they are shown on the rev bar.
- Remain compatible with future Yoep releases.

There are other approaches that could be taken for the status clusters, like flashing the upper 3 buttons on each side of the wheel. I may explore this at some point.
