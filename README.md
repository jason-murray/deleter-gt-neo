# GT Neo iRacing - Custom Profile & Yoep Rev Lights

### Custom Profile Features
- Engine start colour scroll.
- ABS/TC tracked on rotary LEDs.
- Fuel gauge rotary.
- BB rotary.
- P2P rotary.
- Rotary flash for yellow flag.
- Button flash for pit limiter.
- Engine off/spectate blackout.

There are some settings at the top of the ROTARIES scripted content block for assigning effects to specific rotaries, colours and others.

### Yoep Rev Lights
Yoep uses a 3-10-3 layout by default utilising 10 rev lights and two 3 LED status clusters. The GT Neo by Simagic has a 15 LED rev light bar and no status clusters.

I have aimed to provide Yoep's incredibly accurate and valuable work in a suitable format for the GT Neo. The source profile for this project was generated by Floyd's awesome generator.

Aims:
- Provide only rev light bar effects, as the status effects overwrite the edges of the rev bar.
- Centre certain effects and patterns on the rev bar, ie effects that require 6 flashing lights in the middle of the bar are adapted to 5 to centre them.
- Retain pit limiter effects only if they are shown on the rev bar.
- Remain compatible with future Yoep releases.

There are other approaches that could be taken for the status clusters, like flashing the upper 3 buttons on each side of the wheel. I may explore this at some point.
